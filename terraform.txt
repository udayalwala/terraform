terraform: to automate cloud infrastructure or provision of cloud infrastructure

terraform is developed by hashicorp

terraform uses scriptig language called HCL

all terraform scripts ends with .tf

before installing terraform in windows check whether it is installed or not

terraform_0.11.9_windows_386.zip  download

unzip it

set the path of the terraform i.e., where this file is physically loacted

go to my computer

propertes --> advanced system settings -->environment variables -->system variables --> path -->

keywords:

provider
---------
is a keyword  which tells the terraform which provider is using like aws, azure, gcp,oracle etc

which account is using


resources:
----------
in the cloud provider you are doing changes like you might be creating instances, vpc, volume etc

datasource:
----------- 
some existing infrasture details you want to read it

interpolation:
--------------
if you want to read resource attributes 

suppose you created an instance

you want to know the publicIP privteIp, subnetId, availabiltiyzone of the machines etc 

"${}"

remote execution
-----------------

local execution
---------------

file
-----

variables
-----------

outputs
--------

terraform init:
---------------
provider related plugins are automatically installed

to validate the terraform file
------------------------------
terraform validate

to execute the terraform files
----------------------------
terraform apply

terraform state file will stores about your infrastructure and configuration.what are the changes done previously..state file contains previous values or configuration 

interpolation:
-----------------
 
value="${aws_ebs_volume.v1.id}"

resource type
resource name
id

file
------
is a function in terraform which reads the data from a specific file

how to define parameters in terraform
-------------------------------------------
variables

3 types
-------
string/number
lists
map

by default if you dont mention any type it will take string

retrieve values from a variable 
-------------------------------
var.variablename

retrieve values from a resource
---------------------------------
resourcetype.resourcename.attributename

1) we can assign default value to a variable
 type="string"
default="uday"

2) we can assign array of elements to a variable
variable "var1"
{
type="list"
default="[1020,30,"udayalwala"]
}

3) we can print the element in the particular index also

output "any-name-for-output"
{
value="${var.variablename[index-position]"
}

for the above variable position at 3rd index
-----------------------------------------

output "varinlistvalue"
{
value="${var.var1[3]}"
}

it will print udayalwala

how many elements in the list
--------------------------------

length

prints no of elements in the list

to print the no of elements in above list
-----------------------------------------

output "printlenoflist"
{
value="${length.(var.var1)}"

you can use multiple providers in the provicer section
--------------------------------------------------------- 
provider "aws"
{
access_key ="AKIAIFVLSHYWHQ6METYA"
secret_key ="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"
region="ap-southeast-1"
}

provider "aws"
{
alias="mumbai"
access_key ="AKIAIFVLSHYWHQ6METYA"
secret_key ="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"
region="ap-south-1a"
}


when you are creating any resource other than default region you must provide the provider details (provider section has region)..alias name be anything.

ex:    

resource aws_instance "myinstance"
{
provider="aws.mumbai"
ami="ami-0447a12f28fddb066"
instance-type="t2.micro"
}
       
in aws cloudformation if multiple resources are creating an if any one of the resource creation is failed then aws cloudformation rollback and delete the entire resources in the stack

but in terraform there is no rollback option if there are multiple resources creating and any one of the resource creation failed the created resources willnot rollback to previous state or delete, we need to delete manually

to create the resources which depends on other resource we use the depends_on option
